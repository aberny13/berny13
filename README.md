I think I realize what is supposed to happen:
1) if you cloned a file from git and now you want to make changes to it and then push it back up there: 
you first have to add the changes to the file that you would like to push. This can be done with one step with the "git commit -a -m 'message'." 
However, you are able to do it in two steps as well, such as first git add 'nameOfFileYouWantToEnter'. Then you write "git commit -m 'whatever',"
and then you push it to the git repository. 

This change I am making right now; I am later going to add a file to github through another directory.
