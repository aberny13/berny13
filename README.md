Well there is this thing called github and now I'm learning how to use it. 
There were essentially three steps: git init for the directory:
									git commit -a -m "what you want to enter here"
									git push origin 
For whatever reason, the personal access code wasn't working, but that could be becuase I hadn't updated the readMe
document, so, whatever.
